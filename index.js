This bot was made by Peyoway#1989 in Discord.js
Although, Discord.js updates every 5 seconds so maybe this wasn't the best choice.
I don't know why I said the above I don't think this is going on GitHub.
🚀 Boost!!!!!🚀

Trust me you're going to need it.

//I'm not to sure but I think we need discord.js and a discord client to make this.
const Discord = require("discord.js");
const client = new Discord.Client();
//Oh and we also kinda need our token and prefix.
const settings = require("./settings.json");


//So uh when the bot guy is ready and logged in, make him set his set his custom status to some cool thing.
//What? Bots don't have custom status?
//DID I STUTTER??!?!?!
client.on("ready", () => {
    console.log(`Boost has started! We are currently rocking a decent ${client.users.size} users and a ${client.channels.size} servers.`)
    client.user.setPresence({
        status: 'online',
        activity: {
            //NGL I really wanted to put Streaming your behavior to your mom but it was too long.
            name: 'your server.',
            type: 'WATCHING',
        }
    })
});
//I would never reuse my old code...
client.on('guildCreate', guild => {
  console.log(`Oh cool, I just joined ${guild.name} on ${new Date()}`);
})
client.on('guildDelete', guild => {
  console.log(`Aw man... ${guild.name} kicked me out of their server on ${new Date()} `);
})
//If your a bot you get ignored simple as that. There can only be one!
if(message.author.bot) return;

//Ok so now we are gonna have some like commands.. yeah I think those are important. Not too sure though.
